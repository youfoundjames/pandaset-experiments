*Totally a work in progress. Just a place to put stuff while I'm working.*

Investigating and implementing machine learning predictive models on the PandaSet dataset, designed for autonomous driving. Currently focusing on simple object detection. Ultimately I am interested in identifying and classifying irrational driver behavior, which there isn't much at all of in this dataset - if you have suggestions for a dataset which is better documented/maintained than INTERACTION and is less than a terabyte, please send a message.
